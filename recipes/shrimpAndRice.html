    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This recipe is a bright meal with lots of acid, fluffy rice, and juicy
      shrimp—and it only uses one pan. “This could easily become one of my go-to
      weeknight dinners to make,” says recipe tester Renu Dhar. “The flavors are
      clean and simple.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Washing your rice before you cook it removes excess starches, and using
      ingredients like fresh Parmesan cheese and basil leaves will help give the
      recipe a true taste. For extra ingredients or substitutions, add peas for
      a pop of color and a serving of vegetables, and serve shrimp and rice with
      items like garlic bread knots, and lemon Caesar salad.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>5 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
      <li>1 yellow onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>6 cloves garlic, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1/4 cup dry white wine</li>
      <li>2 cups chicken stock</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons lemon zest</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups uncooked jasmine rice, rinsed</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium. Add
        onion, and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft and translucent,
        about 3 minutes. Add garlic, and cook, stirring constantly, until garlic
        is fragrant and onions are lightly browned, about 1 minute. Stir in
        wine, and cook, stirring occasionally, until wine is reduced by half,
        about 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in chicken stock, lemon zest, salt, and black pepper. Bring to a
        boil over medium, and stir in rice. Cover and reduce heat to low.
        Simmer, undisturbed, until rice is just cooked through, 9 to 10 minutes.
        Add shrimp to rice in an even layer; drizzle with lemon juice, and dot
        with remaining 4 tablespoons butter. Cover and continue to cook over
        medium until shrimp and rice are cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from heat. Stir in Parmesan cheese and basil. Garnish with lemon
        wedges and basil leaves.
      </li>
      <li>
        As you are cooking the spaghetti, heat olive oil in a skillet over
        medium heat. Add zucchini and salt and cook, stirring occasionally,
        until it starts to release juices, soften, and break down, 3 to 5
        minutes. Add a couple splashes of the pasta water to the zucchini, but
        don't overdo it. Break zucchini into small pieces with the edge of a
        spoon or spatula. Reduce heat to low and toss in basil and butter; stir
        until butter melts.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grab spaghetti with tongs and transfer it right into the sauce; stir
        until coated. Mix in Pecorino Romano and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheeses.
        Add a final splash of pasta water and adjust salt if needed.
      </li>
      <li>Serve with more grated cheese and fresh basil.</li>
    </ol>
