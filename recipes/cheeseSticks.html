    </p>

    <h2>Make Breading</h2>
    <p>
      In three separate bowls: Mix the eggs and water, the bread crumbs and
      garlic salt, and flour and cornstarch.
    </p>

    <h2>Fry Cheese Sticks</h2>
    <p>
      Heat the oil to 365 degrees F in a heavy saucepan. One at a time, coat
      each mozzarella stick in the flour mixture, then the egg mixture, then in
      the garlic-spiked bread crumbs. Drop the sticks into the hot oil and fry
      for about 30 seconds, or until golden-brown. Drain the fried mozzarella
      sticks on paper towels.
    </p>

    <h2>Mozzarella Sticks Sauce</h2>
    <p>
      Of course, the most popular dipping sauce to pair with mozzarella cheese
      sticks is marinara (make our simple Marinara Dipping Sauce or buy jarred
      sauce at the store). Not into marinara? Shake things up with one of these
      fun ideas:
